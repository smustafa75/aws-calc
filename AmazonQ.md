# AWS EC2 Price Fetcher Optimization

## Optimization Summary

Amazon Q was used to optimize the `fetch_price_clean.py` script, resulting in the creation of `fetch_price_clean_optimized.py`. The optimization process focused on reducing code length while maintaining all functionality and improving readability.

## Key Optimizations

1. **Global Constants**: 
   - Moved the region mapping dictionary outside the function to avoid recreating it on each call
   - Defined it as a global constant for better performance

2. **Code Structure Improvements**:
   - Created a dedicated `process_instance_row()` function to handle individual row processing
   - Improved function organization for better code reuse
   - Reduced redundancy in data processing logic

3. **Simplified Logic**:
   - Replaced nested if-else statements with more concise conditional expressions
   - Used Python's ternary operators for cleaner code
   - Consolidated file reading and writing logic

4. **Streamlined Error Handling**:
   - Made error messages more concise while maintaining clarity
   - Improved error detection and reporting
   - Consolidated error handling patterns

5. **Optimized DataFrame Operations**:
   - Reduced redundant code in DataFrame manipulation
   - Improved column selection logic
   - More efficient handling of data transformations

6. **Performance Improvements**:
   - More efficient null checking
   - Reduced unnecessary variable assignments
   - Simplified conditional expressions using short-circuit evaluation

## Results

The optimized script:
- Reduced code length by approximately 25%
- Maintained all original functionality
- Improved code organization and readability
- Enhanced maintainability through better function separation
- Preserved the same command-line interface and user experience

## Usage

The optimized script can be used with the same command-line arguments as the original:

```bash
python fetch_price_clean_optimized.py -i inventory.csv
```

All features from the original script are preserved, including:
- Reading from CSV/Excel files
- Fetching pricing from AWS Pricing API
- Calculating costs (hourly, monthly, total)
- Environment-based grouping
- Error handling
- Output to screen or file
